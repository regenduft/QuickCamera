Very rarely crashes without releasing camera hardware - you'll need to restart your phone

When the app was developed, no good alternative existed.
In the meantime, if you search for "fast camera" in play store, you don't know which one to pick, there are just tooo many. 

Therfore, development of this app was stopped.
